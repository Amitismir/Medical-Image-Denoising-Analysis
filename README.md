# Biomedical Image Restoration and Filtering

This repository presents a quantitative study of noise modeling and image filtering techniques applied to biomedical images. The project focuses on restoring noisy images using classical spatial and frequency-domain filters and evaluating performance using objective image quality metrics.

## Overview
Medical and biomedical images are often degraded by noise during acquisition and transmission. This project investigates several noise models and filtering techniques to improve image quality and preserve important structural details.

The effectiveness of each method is evaluated using quantitative metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

## Methods Implemented

### Noise Models
- Gaussian noise
- Salt & pepper noise

### Filtering Techniques
- Low-pass filtering (LPF)
- High-pass filtering (HPF)
- Mean filter
- Gaussian filter
- Bilateral filter
- Adaptive filtering

### Evaluation Metrics
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Visual comparison of filtered outputs

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
